D       Bm              F#m
Understand the things I say
      G                    D
Don't turn away from me
              Bm               F#m
Cause I spent half my life out there
    G                      D
You wouldn't disagree

D'you see me, d'you see
Do you like me, do you like me standing there
D'you notice, d'you know
Do you see me, do you see me
Does anyone care

Unhappiness, where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
cause we were raised
To see life as a fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother she hold me
Did she hold me, when I was out there
My father, my father, he liked me
Oh he liked me, does anyone care

Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design
And people everywhere think
Something better than I am
But I miss you, I miss
cause I liked it, I liked it
When I was out there
D'you know this, dyou know
You did not find me, you did not find
Does anyone care

Unhappiness was when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother she hold me
Did she hold me, when I was out there
My father, my father, he liked me
Oh he liked me, does anyone care
