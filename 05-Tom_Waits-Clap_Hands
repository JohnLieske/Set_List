...CLAP HANDS... by Tom Waits

Bm
 Sane, sane, they're all insane,
Fireman's blind; the conductor is lame.
A Cincinnati jacket and a sad-luck dame,
Hanging out the window with a bottle full of rain.
G7          Bm
Clap hands, clap hands.
Clap hands, clap hands.
Bm
Said; roar, roar, the thunder and the roar,
Son of a bitch is never coming back here no more.
The moon in the window and a bird on the pole,
We can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal.
G7          Bm
Clap hands, clap hands.
Clap hands, clap hands.
     G7              Bm
Said; steam, steam; a hundred bad dream,
 Going up to Harlem with a pistol in his jeans.
A fifty-dollar bill, iside a palladin's hat,
And nobody's sure where Mr. Knickerbocker's at.

Son of a bitch is never coming back here no more.
The moon in the window and a bird on the pole,

G7          Bm
Clap hands, clap hands.
Clap hands, clap hands.
     G7              Bm
Said; steam, steam; a hundred bad dream,
 Going up to Harlem with a pistol in his jeans.
A fifty-dollar bill, iside a palladin's hat,
And nobody's sure where Mr. Knickerbocker's at.
B,
Shine, shine, a Roosevelt dime,
All the way to Baltimore and running out of time.
Salvation Army seemed to wind up in the hole,
They all went to Heaven in a little row boat.
G7          Bm
Clap hands, clap hands.
Clap hands, clap hands.
Clap hands, clap hands.
Clap hands, clap hands.
