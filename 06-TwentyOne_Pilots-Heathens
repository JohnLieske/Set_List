[Chorus]
 C                  Am                E
 All my friends are heathens, take it slow
 C                Am              E
 Wait for them to ask you who you know
        C           Am        E
 Please don't make any sudden moves
     C              Am           E
 You don't know the half of the abused
 C                  Am                E
 All my friends are heathens, take it slow
 C                Am              E
 Wait for them to ask you who you know
        C           Am        E
 Please don't make any sudden moves
     C              Am           E
 You don't know the half of the abused
[Verse 1]
Am
 Welcome to the room of people Who have rooms of people that they
 Em
 loved one day, docked away
Am
 Just because we check the guns at the door Doesn't mean our
 Em
 brains will change from hand grenades
Am                                             Em
 You never know the psychopath sitting next to you
                                             Am
 You never know the murderer sitting next to you
                                                 B
 You'll think, "How'd I get here sitting next to you?"
B                         N.C.
 And after all I've said, please don't forget
[Chorus]
 C                  Am                E
 All my friends are heathens, take it slow
 C                Am              E
 Wait for them to ask you who you know
        C           Am        E
 Please don't make any sudden moves
     C              Am           E
 You don't know the half of the abused
[Verse 2]
Am
 We don't deal with outsiders very well
Em
 They say newcomers have a certain smell
Am
 You have trust issues, not to mention
Em
 They say they can smell your intentions
Am                                            Em
 You never know the freakshow sitting next to you
                                            Am
 You have some weird people sitting next to you
                                                  B
 You'll think, "How'd I get here sitting next to you?"
B                         N.C.
 But after all I've said, please don't forget (Watch it)
C Am E E
C Am E E
[Chorus]
 C                  Am                E
 All my friends are heathens, take it slow
 C                Am              E
 Wait for them to ask you who you know
        C           Am        E
 Please don't make any sudden moves
     C              Am           E
 You don't know the half of the abused
[Bridge]
 C                  Am                Em
 All my friends are heathens, take it slow (watch it)
 C                Am              Em
 Wait for them to ask you who you know (watch it)
 C                  Am                Em
 All my friends are heathens, take it slow (watch it)
 C                Am              Em
 Wait for them to ask you who you know (watch it)
[Outro]
 C                   Am                   E
 Why'd you come, you knew you should have stayed
   C                 Am            E
 I tried to warn you just to stay away
     C              Am            E
 And now they're outside ready to bust
    C              Am              E
 It looks like you might be one of us
