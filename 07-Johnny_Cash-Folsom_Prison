I hear the train a-comin'; it's rollin' 'round the bend,

And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
  Bb                                            F
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on.
       C                                      F
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone.

When I was just a baby, my momma told me, "Son,

Always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns."
  Bb                                      F
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.
       C                                      F
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry.

I bet there's rich folk eatin'in a fancy dining car.

They're prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars,
  Bb                                        F
But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free,
       C                                      F
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me.
F
Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine,

I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line,
  Bb                                         F
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay,
       C                                      F
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.
