Well
Some people think I'm damaged 'cause I'm always on my own
But just because the lights are out don't mean you're not at home
And they say when you're psychotic that you never walk alone
I'm just a three-legged dog on the roam

And everybody thinks that I'm unfriendly just because I can't recall their names
But all the faces and the places just begin look the same
You haven't got the kind of time it takes to play those kinds of games
When you're a three-legged dog on the roam

No I may not be good-looking, but I'm a killer in the dark
And girl you know my bite is so much better than my bark
So if you need a friend tonight, why don't you come find me in the park
I'm a three-legged dog on the roam

Y'know my father thinks I'm lazy 'cause I ain't got no career
And my mother thinks I'm crazy, and my sister thinks I'm queer
Ah, but if you think it's easy, man, you just got no idea
I'm a three-legged dog on the roam

Yeah I've been down so long that coming up is giving me the bends
And I'm so goddamn lonesome, I count enemies as friends
And every day I chase my tail and wonder when it's gonna end
For this three-legged dog on the roam

Yeah I'm still looking for that something, gonna make my life complete
Can't afford to be too picky when you're living on the street
But sometimes if I'm a good boy, they'll throw me a piece of meat
I'm just a three-legged dog on the roam
