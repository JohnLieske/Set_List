D       A              D  --  D
Well, I know, I miss more than hit
D             A           D  --  D
With a face that was launched to sink
D      A         Bm       G
An' I seldom feel, the bright relief
D       A              D  --  D
It's been the worst day since yesterday
   D         A      D  --  D
If there's one thing I have said
    D            A                D  --  D
Is that the dreams I once had, now lay in bed
D          A         Bm              G
As the four winds blow, my wits through the door
      D      A         D  --  D
It's been the worst day since yesterday
G                D
Fallin' down to you, sweet ground
G
Where the flowers they bloom
D                        A
Well, it's there I'll be found
D       A      D     G
Hurry back to me, my wild Colleen
      D      A         D  --  D
It's been the worst day since yesterday

A   A   G   D
A   A   G   A

      D          A       D  --  D
Though these wounds have seen no wars
       D       A      D  --  D
Except for the scars I have ignored
 D        A             Bm         G
And this endless crutch, well, it's never enough
      D     A         D  --  D
It's been the worst day since yesterday
G                           D
Hell says hello, well, it's time I should go
G                       D             A
To pastures green, that I've yet to see
D       A      D    G
Hurry back to me, my wild Colleen
      D     A         D  --  D
It's been the worst day since yesterday
      D     A         D  --  D
It's been the worst day since yesterday
      D     A         G  --  G
It's been the worst day since yesterday
D
