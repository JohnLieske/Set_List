"Bad Things" - Jace Everett

Verse 1:
Em              D               Em
  When you came in the air went out
Em           D            Em
  And every shadow filled up with doubt
Am                   Am                   Bm                Em
 I don't know who you think you are, but before the night is through
Em           Bm               Em
   I wanna do bad things with you

Em                 D             Em
   I'm the kind to sit up in his room
Em                D                   Em
   Heart sick and eyes filled up with blue
Am                       Am                Bm                Em
 I don't know what you've done to me, but I know this much is true
Em           Bm               Em
   I wanna do bad things with you

Em           Bm               Em
   I wanna do real bad things with you

Outro:
Am                       Am                Bm                Em
 I don't know what you've done to me, but I know this much is true
Em           Bm               Em      D
   I wanna do bad things with you
Em           Bm               Em
   I wanna do real bad things with you
