Chelsea Hotel#2 - Leonard Cohen
   F           C           Bflat     F
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
         C                       Dm
You were talking so brave and so sweet.
F         C           Bflat
Giving me head on the unmade bed
F         Bflat                  C
While the limousines wait in the street
Dm                         Bflat
Those were the reasons and that was New York,
        F               Am/E          Dm
We were running for the money and the flesh
    Bflat                        F
And that was called love for the workers in song,
         Bflat                      C
Probably still is for those of them left.
         Bflat         F
And then you got away, didn't you, baby?
                     Am/E        Dm
You just turned your back on the crowd.
Bflat                      F
You got away, I never once heard you say,
   Bflat             F           Bflat             F
"I need you, I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you,"
    Bflat               Dm       C (To lead into next verse).
And all of that jiving around.
     F         C           Bflat     F
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
         C                       Dm
You were famous, your heart was a legend.
F         C           Bflat
You told me again you preferred handsome men,
F         Bflat                  C
But for me you would make an exception.
Dm                         Bflat
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
        F               Am/E          Dm
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,
    Bflat                        F
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well, never mind,
         Bflat                      C
We are ugly but we have the music."

Then, after the 2nd verse...
C       F          C           Bflat         F
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
        F             C           Dm
I can't keep track of each fallen robin.
    F          C           Bflat     F
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
     Bflat                          C
That all, I don't think of you that often.
