Lady Midnight â€” Leonard Cohen
  G       G7           F            C
I came by my-self to a very crowded place;
G                 G7              F            C
I was looking for someone who had lines in her face.
  C              C7           F            F
I found her there but she was past all con-cern;
  C            F       Dm               Dm
I asked her to hold me, said, "Lady, un-fold me,"
        C                  F
but she scorned me and she told me
      G   G7                    C
I was dead and I could never re-turn.
       G          G7          F              C
Well, I argued all night like so many have before,
        G             G7                 F            C
saying, "Whatever you give me, I seem to need so much more."
         C            C7       F              F
Then she pointed at me where I kneeled on her floor,
          C             F     Dm               Dm
she said, "Don't try to use me or slyly refuse me,
C              F
just win me or lose me,
      G            G7           C
it is this that the darkness is for."
         G         G7          F                 C
I cried, "Oh, Lady Midnight, I fear that you grow old,
    G              G7           F              C
the stars eat your body and the wind makes you cold."
C /C7 /F /F
"If we cry now," she said, "it will just be ignored."
/C /F Em/Dm /Dm
So I walked through the morning, sweet early morning,
Em7/C /F
I could hear my lady calling,
F /G /G7 /C
"You've won me, you've won me, my lord,
/G /G7 /C
you've won me, you've won me, my lord,
/C /G /G7 /C
yes, you've won me, you've won me, my lord,
/C /G /G7 /C
ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord,
/C /G /G7 /C
ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord."
