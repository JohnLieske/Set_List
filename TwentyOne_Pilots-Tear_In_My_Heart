D-D-D-D F#m-F#m G-G

                              D F#m G
 Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
                              D F#m G
 That you're alive and have a soul
                               A7
 But it takes someone to come around to show you how
                      G           A
 She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
                      Bm            A
 She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
                      D              A                          D F#m G
 She's the tear in my heart, take me higher than I've ever been
                            D F#m G
 The songs on the radio are okay
                               D F#m G
 But my taste in music is your face
                              A7
 And it takes a song to come around to show you how
                      G           A
 She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
                      Bm            A
 She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
                      D              A                     G
 She's the tear in mh heart, take me higher than I've ever been
                Bm   A
 Than I've ever been
                D    A
 Than I've ever been
                D
 Than I've ever been

 You fell asleep in my car
D
 I drove the whole time
D
 But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep
D
 I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government
D
 For not using my taxes
D
 To fill the holes with more cement

 My heart is my armor

 She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther, than I've ever been
                Bm   A
 Than I've ever been
